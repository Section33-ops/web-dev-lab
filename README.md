# Web Dev Lab

This repository is my main learning laboratory for becoming a web developer.
It contains all my daily practice, experiments, and small isolated components
built while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Folder Structure

- **daily-practice/**  
  Chronological daily folders (day-01, day-02, etc.) containing:

  - `notes.md` – what I learned that day
  - `practice.html` – small exercises
  - `mini-project/` – small focused tasks

- **components/**  
  Reusable UI elements such as:

  - navbars
  - cards
  - forms
  - buttons
  - hero sections

- **layouts/**  
  Page layouts or structure templates.

- **css-practice/**  
  CSS-focused experiments (flexbox, grid, animations, responsiveness).

- **js-experiments/**  
  Small JavaScript snippets or concept tests.

## Purpose

This repo is not for polished projects.  
It’s for:

- fast experimentation
- building muscle memory
- tracking progress
- testing ideas
- improving every day

Full standalone projects will go into a different repo:
**awesome-web-projects**

## Commit Strategy

I commit:

- at least once daily
- clear commit messages
- small, incremental progress
